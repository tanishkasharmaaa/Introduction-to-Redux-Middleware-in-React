# Learnings from the project

# Understanding Redux Middleware Thunk:
 Gain an understanding of Redux Thunk middleware, which allows you to write asynchronous action creators that return functions instead of plain action objects. Learn how to set up Redux Thunk and apply it to your Redux store.

# Integrating Redux Logger:
 Learn how to install and configure Redux Logger middleware, which provides logging for Redux actions and state changes. Understand how to apply Redux Logger to your Redux store to aid in debugging and understanding application behavior.

# Asynchronous Action Creators: 
Practice writing asynchronous action creators using Redux Thunk. Learn how to dispatch asynchronous actions such as fetching data from an API and handle the asynchronous nature of these actions.

# Middleware Configuration:
 Gain experience in setting up and configuring middleware in Redux. Understand the process of applying middleware to the Redux store and how it enhances the store's functionality.

# Real-time Data Updates:
 Implement real-time data updates by fetching data from an API based on user actions (sorting) and updating the Redux store accordingly. Understand how Redux facilitates state management and updates in React applications.

# UI Components and Interaction:
 Develop UI components such as grids and sidebars for displaying and interacting with data. Implement sorting options in the sidebar to allow users to sort the coffee list based on their preferences.

# Observing State Changes: 
Observe how actions are dispatched and state is modified in the application by logging Redux actions and state changes to the console using Redux Logger. Gain insights into how Redux manages state and handles asynchronous actions.
